## Visualising Madeira

A visualisation project which tries to paint a picture of Madeira by visualising data across 4 different categories which are critical to the island. These categories are - Demographics, Eenrgy, Climate and General Historical Information about the island. The project not only gives an overview about all these categories but also gives a real time visualisation across these categories.
The project aim to follow an storytelling approach to inform the users about the island, its people, its environment and historical information.
